    "In this notebook, we'll explore **agent memory systems** - the ability for AI agents to remember information across interactions. We'll implement all five memory types from the **CoALA (Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents)** framework while building on our Personal Wellness Assistant use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand the 5 memory types from the CoALA framework\n",
    "- Implement short-term memory with checkpointers and thread_id\n",
    "- Build long-term memory with InMemoryStore and namespaces\n",
    "- Use semantic memory for meaning-based retrieval\n",
    "- Apply episodic memory for few-shot learning from past experiences\n",
    "- Create procedural memory for self-improving agents\n",
    "- Combine all memory types into a unified wellness agent\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Walking**: A brisk walk in the morning can be a great way to start your day. It’s low-impact and can help clear your mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Swimming**: If you have access to a pool, swimming is an excellent full-body workout that is easy on the joints.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Yoga**: Gentle yoga or restorative yoga can help with relaxation and flexibility. Look for classes that focus on calming poses and breathing techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pilates**: This can help strengthen your core and improve your posture without putting too much strain on your knee. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cycling**: If you have a stationary bike or can ride a bike on flat terrain, this is a great way to get your heart rate up without stressing your knee.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Tai Chi**: This is a gentle form of martial arts that focuses on slow, controlled movements and can be very calming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since you prefer to work out in the morning and are available on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, you could create a balanced routine that includes a mix of these activities. Just be sure to listen to your body and modify any movements that cause discomfort.\n",

      "To help you reach your goals of improving sleep, reducing stress, and building consistency, I recommend the following types of exercises that align with your preferences and fitness level:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Walking**: Incorporate brisk walks into your routine on your available days (Mon, Wed, Fri, Sat). Aim for 20-30 minutes to start, gradually increasing the duration as you feel comfortable. Walking is a great way to clear your mind and reduce stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Gentle Yoga**: Practice gentle or restorative yoga sessions, focusing on poses that promote relaxation and flexibility. You can do this on your available days, either at home or in a class setting. Yoga can also help alleviate some discomfort in your lower back.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Swimming**: If you have access to a pool, swimming is an excellent low-impact exercise that can improve your overall fitness without straining your knee or back. Aim for 30 minutes of light swimming on your available days.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consistency**: Establish a routine by scheduling these activities on your available days. For example, you could walk on Mon and Fri, do yoga on Wed, and swim on Sat.\n",

    "A production wellness system would utilize a hybrid memory architecture that separates fast, in-memory storage (like Redis) for ephemeral conversation context from persistent, strongly consistent databases (like PostgreSQL) for safety-critical data. User profiles containing allergies and conditions would be stored centrally to ensure a single source of truth accessible by all specialized agents simultaneously.\n",

      "User: Give me a summary of my wellness this week. What patterns do you see?\n",
      "\n",
      "Assistant:\n",
      "This week, your wellness data indicates a declining trend across several key areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mood**: Your average mood rating is 4.5/10, with a recent decline reflected in your last three readings (6, 5, 3). This suggests fluctuations in your emotional state, with a noticeable drop.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Energy Levels**: Your average energy level is 3.33/10, also showing a decline. The last three readings (5, 2, 3) indicate that you may be feeling more fatigued or less motivated recently.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sleep Quality**: With an average of 4/10, your sleep quality is also declining. The last three readings (5, 3, 4) suggest inconsistency in how well you are sleeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Patterns**:\n",
      "- Overall, your wellness metrics are trending downward, particularly in energy and mood.\n",
      "- There may be a connection between your energy levels and mood, as lower energy can impact how you feel emotionally.\n",
      "- Sleep quality appears to be fluctuating, which could be contributing to both your energy and mood challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Steps**:\n",
      "1. **Prioritize Sleep**: Aim for a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine to improve sleep quality.\n",
      "2. **Incorporate Light Exercise**: Even short walks or gentle stretching can boost your energy levels and improve your mood.\n",
      "3. **Connect with Others**: Reach out to friends or family for social support, which can help enhance your mood and provide a sense of connection.\n",

      "Assistant:\n",
      "Feeling tired can be challenging, but there are several strategies you can try to boost your energy levels:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Regular Physical Activity**: Incorporate light exercise into your daily routine, such as walking, stretching, or yoga. Even short bursts of activity can increase your energy and improve your mood.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Stay Hydrated**: Dehydration can lead to fatigue. Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day. Aim for at least 8 cups (64 ounces) daily, adjusting based on your activity level.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Balanced Nutrition**: Focus on eating a balanced diet rich in whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid excessive sugar and processed foods, as they can lead to energy crashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, consider evaluating your sleep habits to ensure you're getting quality rest, as this can significantly impact your energy levels. Would you like more specific tips on any of these areas?\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Enhance Sleep Quality**:\n",
      "   - Aim for a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time each day.\n",
      "   - Create a calming bedtime routine, such as reading or meditating, to signal to your body that it’s time to wind down.\n",
      "   - Limit screen time at least an hour before bed to improve sleep quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Boost Energy Levels**:\n",
      "   - Incorporate light physical activity into your daily routine, such as a 10-15 minute walk or gentle stretching.\n",
      "   - Stay hydrated and consider keeping a water bottle nearby to remind yourself to drink throughout the day.\n",
      "   - Focus on balanced meals that include protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates to sustain your energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Engage in Social Connections**:\n",
      "   - Reach out to friends or family for a chat or plan a social activity, even if it’s virtual. Social interactions can help lift your mood and provide support.\n",
      "   - Consider joining a group or class that aligns with your interests to foster new connections.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we explored the **5 memory types** from the CoALA framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Memory Type | LangGraph Component | Scope | Wellness Use Case |\n",
    "|-------------|---------------------|-------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Short-term** | `MemorySaver` + `thread_id` | Within thread | Current consultation |\n",
    "| **Long-term** | `InMemoryStore` + namespaces | Across threads | User profile, goals |\n",
    "| **Semantic** | Store + embeddings + `search()` | Across threads | Knowledge retrieval |\n",
    "| **Episodic** | Store + few-shot examples | Across threads | Past successful interactions |\n",
    "| **Procedural** | Store + self-reflection | Across threads | Self-improving instructions |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory transforms chatbots into assistants** - Persistence enables personalization\n",
    "2. **Different memory types serve different purposes** - Choose based on your use case\n",
    "3. **Context management is critical** - Trim and summarize to stay within limits\n",
    "4. **Episodic memory enables learning** - Show, don't just tell\n",
    "5. **Procedural memory enables adaptation** - Agents can improve themselves\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `PostgresSaver` instead of `MemorySaver` for persistent checkpoints\n",
    "- Use `PostgresStore` instead of `InMemoryStore` for persistent long-term memory\n",
    "- Consider TTL (Time-to-Live) policies for automatic memory cleanup\n",
    "- Implement proper access controls for user data\n",
